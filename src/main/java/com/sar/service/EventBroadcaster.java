/**
 * EventBroadcaster manages Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections and broadcasts events to all connected clients.
 * 
 * This service maintains a thread-safe collection of client connections and provides methods to:
 * - Register new SSE client connections
 * - Remove disconnected clients
 * - Broadcast events to all active clients
 * 
 * Thread Safety Considerations:
 * Multiple ConnectionThread instances may simultaneously register/remove clients or trigger broadcasts.
 * The implementation must handle concurrent access without data corruption or missed events.
 * 
 * SSE Event Format:
 * Events are sent as text in the format:
 *   data: <event-data>\n\n
 * 
 * For structured data (e.g., JSON):
 *   data: {"type": "group.created", "group": {...}}\n\n
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - GroupServiceImpl calls broadcast() when groups are created, updated, or deleted
 * - EventHandler registers client OutputStreams when /events endpoint is requested
 * - ConnectionThread may need to clean up disconnected clients
